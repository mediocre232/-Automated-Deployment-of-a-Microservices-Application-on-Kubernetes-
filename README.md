- **Kubernetes Deployment**: YAML configurations for deploying the services on Kubernetes.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, EKS, GKE)
- kubectl configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster

### Deployment Steps
1. **Build and Push Docker Images**: 
   Use the provided Dockerfiles to build images for the frontend and backend services and push them to a Docker registry.
   ```bash
   docker build -t [your-docker-repo]/frontend:latest ./frontend
   docker push [your-docker-repo]/frontend:latest
   # Repeat for backend
